### Trilated is a skin based off Dashed - With Trilated, we're going for a more "osu!lazer-ey" look, featuring triangles, magenta, and much more!

### Installing the skin is super simple! Just head to the download link, linked above. And download the .osk file! After doing so, make sure you have osu! open in the background and open the file! Boom! You now have the skin installed.
###  
### If you want to revert/change it at any time, go to the osu! options, then go to the section Skin (paint brush icon), and there you go!
